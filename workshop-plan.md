- [ ] Familiarity with CI/CD concepts

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 AWS Environment Setup
- [ ] Create AWS account and configure billing alerts
- [ ] Set up IAM users and roles for Terraform
- [ ] Configure AWS CLI and credentials
- [ ] Create S3 bucket for Terraform state
- [ ] Set up DynamoDB table for state locking

### 1.2 Local Development Environment

- [ ] Implement approval policies
- [ ] Create approval notification system

## Phase 3: Cost Controls & Monitoring (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Cost Controls
- [ ] Implement AWS Cost Explorer integration
- [ ] Set up budget alerts
- [ ] Create cost estimation in Terraform plans
- [ ] Implement resource tagging strategy

### 3.2 Monitoring Integration
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- [ ] Configure infrastructure alerts
- [ ] Implement logging for Terraform operations
- [ ] Create dashboards for infrastructure metrics

## Phase 4: Compliance & Operations (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Compliance Validation

- [ ] Set up security scanning
- [ ] Create compliance reporting
- [ ] Implement policy as code

### 4.2 Rollback Procedures
- [ ] Create rollback strategies
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement state backup/restore
- [ ] Document emergency procedures

## Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization (Week 9-10)

### 5.1 Hugo Documentation
- [ ] Set up Hugo site structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add tutorials and examples
- [ ] Deploy documentation site

### 5.2 Operational Procedures
- [ ] Create runbooks
- [ ] Document troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Set up team training materials
- [ ] Create maintenance procedures

## Recommended Starting Steps

1. **Start with AWS Setup**: Configure your AWS account and create the necessary IAM roles
2. **Basic Terraform**: Create a simple VPC and EC2 instance to understand the workflow
3. **Version Control**: Set up your Git repository structure
4. **Atlantis Deployment**: Deploy Atlantis in a simple configuration
5. **Iterate and Expand**: Gradually add more complex features

## Key Deliverables
- Working Terraform infrastructure
- Atlantis-based approval workflow
- Cost monitoring and controls
- Compliance validation framework
- Complete documentation site
- Operational procedures and runbooks

## Success Metrics
- Automated provisioning time < 15 minutes
- 100% infrastructure as code coverage
- Cost visibility and control mechanisms
- Compliance validation automated
- Documentation completeness > 90%
