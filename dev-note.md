## **Technical Notes**

### **Architecture Decisions**

-   **Native Terraform Validation**: Chose `lifecycle.precondition` blocks over OPA for simplicity and native integration
-   **AWS Production Focus**: Designed for real AWS infrastructure deployment, not just simulation
-   **PowerShell Automation**: Used PowerShell for Windows compatibility and AWS CLI integration
-   **Modular Structure**: Organized Terraform code into logical modules for maintainability

### **Key Implementation Details**

-   **Compliance Validation**: 6 validation rules covering instance types, tags, S3 naming, security groups, encryption, and public access
-   **Cost Optimization**: Restricted to t3.micro, t3.small, t3.medium instances
-   **Security**: AES256 encryption, public access blocking, least-privilege IAM policies
-   **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration with log groups, alarms, and VPC flow logs

### **Lessons Learned**

-   **Validation Timing**: Terraform validation blocks run during plan phase, providing early feedback
-   **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages are crucial for user experience
-   **Testing Strategy**: Real violation scenarios help validate compliance enforcement
-   **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is essential for workshop success

### **Future Enhancements**

-   Multi-environment workflows (dev, staging, prod)
-   Advanced compliance policies with OPA integration
-   Automated testing with terratest
-   Disaster recovery automation
-   Cost optimization recommendations
