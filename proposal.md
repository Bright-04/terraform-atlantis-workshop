## 1. Project Background

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional infrastructure provisioning often suffers from:

-   **Manual deployment processes** leading to configuration drift and human errors
-   **Lack of compliance enforcement** resulting in security vulnerabilities and cost overruns
-   **Inconsistent approval workflows** causing deployment delays and audit issues
-   **Limited monitoring integration** making it difficult to track infrastructure health and costs
-   **Absence of rollback procedures** increasing risk during production deployments

### 1.2 Solution Approach

This project implements a comprehensive **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** solution using:

-   **Terraform v1.6.0** for infrastructure provisioning and management
-   **Atlantis** for GitOps workflow automation and approval processes
-   **Native Terraform validation** for real-time compliance enforcement
-   **AWS Production Environment** for real-world infrastructure deployment
-   **PowerShell automation** for operational procedures and monitoring

### 1.3 Workshop Objectives

The workshop demonstrates:

1. **Automated Environment Provisioning** with Terraform
2. **Approval Workflows** using GitHub PRs and Atlantis
3. **Cost Controls** through policy-based validation
4. **Monitoring Integration** with CloudWatch and health checks
5. **Compliance Validation** using native Terraform blocks
6. **Rollback Procedures** for emergency situations
7. **Operational Procedures** for day-to-day management
8. **Comprehensive Documentation** for knowledge transfer
