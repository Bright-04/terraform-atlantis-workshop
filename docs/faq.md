-   Posts results back to PR comments

### Q: What is compliance validation?

**A**: Compliance validation ensures:

-   Only cost-effective instance types (t3.micro, t3.small, t3.medium)
-   Required tags (Environment, Project, CostCenter)
-   S3 bucket naming conventions
-   Security best practices
-   Prevents deployment of non-compliant resources

### Q: Can I use a different cloud provider?

**A**: This workshop is designed for AWS, but the concepts apply to other providers. You would need to:

-   Modify Terraform configurations
-   Update provider configurations
-   Adjust compliance validation rules
-   Update monitoring scripts

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Configuration

### Q: How do I configure AWS credentials?

**A**:

```powershell
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Verify configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Q: What permissions do I need?

**A**: You need permissions for:

-   EC2 (create, describe, terminate instances)
-   S3 (create, delete buckets)
-   IAM (create roles and policies)
-   VPC (create networks and security groups)
-   CloudWatch (create logs and metrics)

### Q: Can I use existing AWS resources?

**A**: Yes, but be careful:

-   The workshop creates new resources
-   Ensure no naming conflicts
-   Use different regions if needed
-   Review the Terraform plan before applying

### Q: How do I customize the configuration?

**A**: Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
# Customize these values
instance_type = "t3.small"
instance_count = 3
environment = "development"
```
